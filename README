Simple Python web app to implement an internet timer and switch

Functionality:

- Provides a web page showing the status of the internet
- Maintains a credit amount of internet (measured in seconds) using mysql
- When the internet is enabled, the credit counts down
- The internet can be enabled/disabled using buttons
- When the credit is exhausted the internet is automatically disabled and
    cannot be enabled until more credit is available
- Monitors packet flow on the internet to measure activity
     (at some point this could automatically disable the internet when not in
      use)
